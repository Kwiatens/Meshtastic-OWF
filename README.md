# Meshtastic powered Offgrid Weather Forecaster (OWF)
An offgrid, local, [Meshtastic](https://meshtastic.org/)® powered weather forecaster that does **NOT** use interntet for forecasting. **It uses it's own sensors to calculate weather predictions using a Zambretti algorithm.**

## [This project is work-in progress!]

$P_0 = P \left( 1 - \frac{0.0065h}{T + 0.0065h + 273.15} \right)^{-5.257}$
